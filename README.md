Project Summary:

The project involved combining different tables using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create a consolidated table. The purpose of this consolidation was to facilitate easier visualization and analysis of insights. Once the consolidated table was created, a dashboard was developed using Power BI.

The project began by identifying the relevant tables that contained the required data for analysis. These tables might have contained information from different sources or represented different aspects of the data. By leveraging the power of SSMS, the tables were joined together based on common keys or relationships, ensuring that the resulting consolidated table contained all the necessary information.

Once the consolidated table was created, it served as a central repository of data, bringing together information from different sources. This consolidation simplified the process of visualizing and analyzing insights since analysts could now access a single table instead of navigating multiple tables. Moreover, the consolidated table eliminated the need to repeat complex queries or joins each time the data needed to be analyzed.

To make the consolidated data more accessible and visually appealing, a dashboard was built using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that allows for the creation of interactive and dynamic visualizations. The dashboard was designed to present the consolidated data in a visually appealing manner, enabling users to gain insights at a glance.

The dashboard included various visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables that represented key metrics, trends, and patterns in the data. Users could interact with the dashboard, filtering data based on specific criteria or drilling down into specific details. This interactivity enhanced the ability to explore and uncover meaningful insights from the consolidated data.

Overall, the project successfully utilized SSMS to combine different tables into a consolidated table, simplifying data visualization and analysis. The resulting dashboard built with Power BI provided users with a user-friendly and interactive interface to explore and derive insights from the consolidated data, enabling better decision-making and data-driven strategies.
