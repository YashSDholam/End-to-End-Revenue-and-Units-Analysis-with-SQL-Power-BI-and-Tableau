In this project, I used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to combine multiple tables into a consolidated table for easier visualization and analysis of insights. By leveraging SSMS, I joined the tables based on common keys or relationships, creating a central repository of data.

To enhance the accessibility and visual appeal of the consolidated data, I created a dashboard using Power BI. This interactive dashboard included various visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables, presenting key metrics, trends, and patterns in the data. Users could explore the data by applying filters and drilling down into specific details, enabling better decision-making and data-driven strategies.
